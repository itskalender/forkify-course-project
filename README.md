## forkify Course Project

forkify is a course project designed for [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. I worked on this project and coded along with Jonas, and this repository was created to sharpen my knowledge of JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
