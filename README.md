## forkify - Course Project

forkify is a course project designed for [The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman?lang=en). I worked on this project and coded along with Jonas, and this repository was created to sharpen my knowledge of JavaScript, Git and GitHub.
